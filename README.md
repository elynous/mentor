# mentor

So there are two folders `client` and `server`. The Frontend code will be in `client` and Backend code in `server`. The `docs` folder is for the Frontend Design, we had used the **Adobe XD** for that. 

> The Frontend `client` is bootstrapped with `Create React App`

## Getting Started

Please have these installed on your machine:
- ![Node.js 12+](https://nodejs.org/en/)

If you are working in `Yarn` then: 
- ![Yarn v1](https://yarnpkg.com/getting-started/install)

We are using two seperate folders for Frontend and Backend so you have to run both the folders separetaly on your local-machine: 

Install dependencies inside of both folders by using:
```
npm install || yarn
``` 

Start the `client` by going inside the `client` folder:
```
npm start || yarn start
```
Similar with `server` folder also

Runs the app in the development mode.
Open http://localhost:3000 to view it in browser.
